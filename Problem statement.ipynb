    "## **1. Introduction & Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal. The **World Happiness Report** is a landmark global survey that ranks countries based on how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. Understanding the drivers of happiness is essential for policymakers, economists, and social scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exam, you will step into the role of a **Data Analyst/Scientist** at a global think tank. You have been tasked with analyzing **five years of World Happiness Report data (2015–2019)** to uncover insights into the factors that contribute to national happiness and how these trends evolve over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to **clean, merge, analyze, and interpret the data**, then present your findings in a comprehensive analytical report.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. The Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are provided with **five datasets**, one for each year:  \n",
    "**2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each dataset contains indicators such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Happiness Score and Rank  \n",
    "- Economy (GDP per Capita)  \n",
    "- Social Support  \n",
    "- Healthy Life Expectancy  \n",
    "- Freedom to Make Life Choices  \n",
    "- Generosity  \n",
    "- Perceptions of Corruption  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note:**  \n",
    "Column names and structures vary across years.  \n",
    "- 2015–2017 share similar column names.  \n",
    "- 2018–2019 use different naming conventions.  \n",
    "You must carefully examine and standardize them before combining.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **3. Tasks & Questions (70 Points)**\n",

    "  - `gdp_per_capita`\n",
    "  - `social_support`\n",
    "  - `healthy_life_expectancy`\n",
    "- Use the mappings for **2015–2017** as a guide and create equivalent mappings for **2018 and 2019**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 2: Region Handling**\n",
    "- The **2018 and 2019** datasets do *not* include a `region` column.  \n",
    "- Create a master region lookup using **2015 or 2016** data.  \n",
    "- Map region values to the 2018 and 2019 datasets.\n",

    "  - `standard_error`  \n",
    "  are missing in **2018 and 2019**.\n",
    "- Add these columns with `NaN` values to maintain uniform structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 4: Add a Year Column**\n",
    "- Before merging, add a **`year`** column to each DataFrame indicating the dataset's year.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Step 5: Final Merge**\n",
    "- Vertically concatenate all five DataFrames into one:  \n",
